I know that you're mine
But I wish we could pause and press rewind
When I'm not with you
Boy, you got me hopin' for a redo
Run out of time
So why we can't just pause and press rewind
When I'm not with you
Boy, you got me hopin' for a redo
I know that you're mine
I know that you're mine
Mine
I know that you're mine
Mine, mine, mine
Hopin' for a redo
I know that you're mine
But I wish we could pause and press rewind
When I'm not with you
Boy, you got me hopin' for a redo
Run out of time
So why we can't just pause and press rewind
When I'm not with you
Boy, you got me hopin' for a redo
I know that you're mine
I know that you're mine
Mine, mine, mine
I know that you're mine
Mine, mine, mine
Hopin' for a redo
I know that you're mine
But I wish we could pause and press rewind
When I'm not with you
Boy, you got me hopin' for a redo
Run out of time
So why we can't just pause and press rewind
When I'm not with you
Boy, you got me hopin' for a redo
