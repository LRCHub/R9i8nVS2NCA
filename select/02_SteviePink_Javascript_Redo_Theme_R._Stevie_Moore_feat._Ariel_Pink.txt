I was housebreaking some classical
Boxcar Willie, and it occured to me:
My wrench had become soggy.
Oversaturation of water from the Caribbean.
I contacted my barber, and he told me,
"It's just the system." And THAT'S when I turned pink.

"Now, whaddya call this music, Steve?"
Ariel Green
"Yeah?"
That's right.
"Well, I call it StevePink.
Jump in whenever you want. Fill in the blank space, if you would."
I'll do what I can.
Michael Zanna, Michael Zanna, Michael Zanna,
Michael Zanna, Michael Zanna, Michael Zanna,
Michael Zanna, Michael Zanna, Michael Zanna,

"R. Stevie, it's nice to meetcha"
My pleasure
"It's such a thrill."
You do great shit.
"Aw thanks, man, you too."
And I like the way that you do that...
"Dig the time you shift the lip there (?)"
Uh huh. "Right." Uh huh. "Right. Exactly."
Borax. It's like Borax, exactly!
"My name is Pink, and no one knows me
I'm really big in South Dakota"
I knew your grandmother back...
"You tell all your friends about me,
And I'll tell all my friends about you."
Yeah, but, your friends left me.
"What?"
For YOU!
"Man, that's low."
IT'S TRUE!!
"Now does this guarantee that I get your tapes for free now?"
I was thinking about running for Senate.
"Now I know that's not your thing, you can blow yourself a chance now"
I was thinking about you as my running mate, Pink.
"Hey, I was supposed to say that."
You're a little slow.
"Uhhhh."
See??
"Uhh, yeh."
Ha ha ha.
"Fuck this."
"R. Stevie, you're very cool."
No question.
"Your music rules."
Thank you. You too.
"Aw, you're just fibbing."
No, I'm serious!
"For real?"
Yeah!
"Hell, yes."
No question! You're better than I am!
"...too much fantasy in there (?)"
No, this is reality we're speaking about.
"I must admit RPinks a pimp (???)"
Orchestra, come in
"Get a lead guitar!"
Come on in, YES.
"I think this shit's giving me bad vibes, man."
Too high tech?
"The stars about to shake, the storm's about to break now.
Here's the climax, Steve, don't let me down, don't release a frown
The stars about to shake, the form's about to break now.
I only got a couple extras."
"The stars about to shake, the phone's about to break now.
Stevie! Stevie!"

Pink is whack, Pink is whack,
Pink is whack, Pink is whack, everybody now
Ariel Pink! Ariel Ariel!
"Stevie! Pink..."
"Getcha!"
"SteviePink SteviePink..."
Pink is whack, Pink is whack,
Pink is whack, Pink is whack, everybody now
Pink is whack, Pink is whack,
Pink is whack, Pink is whack, everybody now
Everybody now
Everybody party like it's 1999.
"You mean Prince.
No, too much R. Stevie. It's all your fault."
Have your lawyer call my lawyer, yeah.
"Yeah,???"
No way
"Just a mirror, right?"
No.
"Just in the air" (???)
No, you're outta your mind
Everybody now. Everybody now.
Pink is whack, Pink is whack,
Pink is whack, Pink is whack, everybody now
"Is Crystyna in the house?
Can I get myself a shout now?
Hi Crystyna!" (HI MIKE.)
"Are the????
We can really send her home" (?)
Hey, we're really upset.
"You're so dead, pal."
Hey, fuck you, man!
"Lighten up, man!"
Eat me!
"What???"
You heard it!
"Screw ya."
Okay.
"You don't deserve my services anyway.
OK, turn off the tape."
